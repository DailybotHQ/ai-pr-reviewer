name: code-review
description: Local companion to the DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer GitHub Action — runs the SAME code-review methodology (severity model, tool-use pattern, output format) against the current branch's changes without opening a pull request. Auto-detects and layers repo-specific `.review/extension.md` (or `.github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md` as fallback) on top of the shipped default prompt for full parity with what the CI action would report. Use when the developer wants a local pre-flight review before pushing, asks "run a code review on my current changes", or is iterating on prompt-extension rules and wants to test them locally before shipping to CI.

# Code Review — Local Companion Skill

The **official local companion** to the
[`DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer`](https://github.com/DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer)
GitHub Action. It gives your local coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex,
Gemini, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf) the exact same review methodology that
the CI action would run on your PR — but on the branch you're working on
right now, without pushing.

**Why:** dogfood your PR review before pushing. Catch what CI would catch,
locally, in seconds. Iterate on `prompt-extension-file` rules without a
full push→CI→wait→review cycle.

**Version parity:** this skill ships with the exact same
[`prompt.md`](prompt.md) that the action shipped in the same tagged
release. Pinning `@v1.4.2` for both the action and this skill guarantees
local ↔ CI parity.

## Install

```bash
# Latest v1.x
npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer --skill code-review

# Or pin to a specific tag for reproducibility
npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1.4.2 --skill code-review
```

This vendors the skill into `.agents/skills/code-review/` in the consumer
repo and records source + content hash in `skills-lock.json` so any
teammate can restore identical bytes with `npx skills experimental_install`.
Bump to the latest with `npx skills update code-review`.

## What it does

Two coordinated capabilities, routed by intent:

| Capability | Sub-skill | When it fires |
|---|---|---|
| **Run a local review** | (this file — default flow) | Developer wants CI-parity review of the current branch's diff before pushing |
| **Generate the extension file** | [`generate-extension`](generate-extension/SKILL.md) | Developer wants to customize the reviewer to this repo — "generate a `.review/extension.md` for this project" |

Both share the same shipped [`prompt.md`](prompt.md) as the base — one
runs it, the other tailors what layers on top.

## Activation

**Default flow (run a review) — triggers:**

- "Review my current branch"
- "Run a code review on my changes"
- "Do a pre-flight review before I push"
- "Code review the diff against `main`"
- "What would CI say about my current commits?"

**Generate-extension flow — triggers:**

- "Generate a `.review/extension.md` for this repo"
- "Customize the code review for our project"
- "Help me write repo-specific review rules"
- "Set up the AI reviewer for this codebase"
- "Tailor the reviewer to our stack"

If the trigger is ambiguous (e.g. developer says "help me with the
review" on a repo that has no `.review/extension.md` yet), ask ONE
clarifying question before routing.

Some harnesses (Claude Code, Cursor) also expose these as slash
commands (`/code-review`, `/code-review-generate-extension`); check
the harness's skill-invocation docs.

---

## Step 0 — Trust boundary

This skill is **read-only** on the working tree and does **not** call any
remote API. It:

- Reads files from the current git checkout (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`).
- Runs `git diff` and `git log` locally (no push, no fetch).
- Composes the review prompt in the agent's context and produces the
  review as terminal output.

It does **not**:

- Post inline comments to GitHub (that's the CI action's job).
- Modify any file in the working tree.
- Call the LLM provider directly — it uses the coding agent that's
  already running you.
- Send any data off your machine.

If the coding agent has broader powers (e.g. can write files or run
arbitrary bash), those come from the harness, not this skill.

---

## Step 1 — Detect context

Run these to establish the review's inputs. Emit the JSON to your working
context; do not print it to the user unless they ask.

```bash
# Base branch: prefer the tracked upstream's short name, fall back to `main`.
BASE=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' 2>/dev/null | sed 's|.*/||')
BASE="${BASE:-main}"

# Current branch + head SHA
HEAD_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

# The three artifacts the review needs
git diff --stat "origin/${BASE}...HEAD"    # summary of what changed
git diff "origin/${BASE}...HEAD"           # the actual diff
git log "origin/${BASE}..HEAD" --oneline   # the commit trail
```

If the diff is empty, tell the developer "no changes vs `<BASE>` — nothing
to review" and stop. If `origin/${BASE}` doesn't exist (fresh clone,
missing remote), fall back to `git merge-base main HEAD` and diff against
that; note the fallback in the summary.

---

## Step 2 — Compose the prompt (base + extension)

The review methodology lives in [`prompt.md`](prompt.md) — the exact same
prompt the CI action ships. Read it into your context as the base.

Then check for a **repo-specific extension** in this order of precedence
(first match wins; the rest are ignored):

1. `.review/extension.md` (recommended convention — runtime-agnostic)
2. `.github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md` (fallback for teams that prefer
   `.github/` sibling to workflow files)

Read the matching file (if any) and append its content to the base prompt
verbatim. If neither exists, use the base prompt alone — no error, no
warning.

Announce the composed configuration in one line, e.g.
`Reviewing feat/foo (a1b2c3d) against main. Base prompt + .review/extension.md.`

The final composed prompt is what governs the review — the severity
definitions, the "what NOT to comment on" rules, the output shape.

---

## Step 3 — Execute the review

Apply the composed prompt to the diff **using the coding agent's own
tools** (Read, Grep, Glob):

- The prompt tells you to `read_file` / `grep` / `glob` — translate those
  to whatever primitives the harness gives you. Read the changed files in
  full; the diff alone is rarely enough context.
- The prompt tells you to `post_inline_comment(path, line, body, severity)`
  — since you are running locally without GitHub write access, instead
  **collect** each finding into an internal list of
  `{path, line, severity, body}` records and print them as a table in
  Step 4.
- The prompt tells you to `submit_review(summary)` **exactly once** — this
  is your cue that the review is complete. When you reach this point,
  print the final summary and stop.

**Cost discipline:** cap yourself at the same number of turns the CI
action does (~25) and the same inline-comment cap (default 20). Don't
grep the whole world; grep the files you're commenting on plus their
imports.

---

## Step 4 — Print the review

Emit the review to the terminal in the **same format** the CI bot would
post on a PR — this is the parity contract:

```markdown
## Verdict
<one sentence — "Looks good", "Blocking security fix needed", etc.>

## Findings

| # | Severity | File | Summary |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | 🚨 critical | `src/auth.ts:55` | SQL injection in raw-string login query |
| 2 | ⚠️ warning  | `src/cache.ts:120` | Unbounded cache key cardinality |
| 3 | ℹ️ info     | `tests/utils.ts:12` | Helper could be reused from existing fixture |

### 1. `src/auth.ts:55` — 🚨 critical
<the full finding body — 2-4 sentences + optional ```suggestion block```>

### 2. `src/cache.ts:120` — ⚠️ warning
<...>

### 3. `tests/utils.ts:12` — ℹ️ info
<...>

## Notes (no inline anchor)
- <cross-cutting concerns, architecture, test-strategy comments>

**Recommendation:** approve / request-changes / comment-only
```

Reproducing this exact shape (verdict → findings table → per-finding
body → notes → recommendation) is what lets a developer trust "the
local review says X, so CI will say X too."

---

## Step 5 — Extension file convention (for consumers)

If a maintainer wants repo-specific rules layered on top of the base
prompt, create **either**:

**Option A — `.review/extension.md`** (recommended):

```
mi-repo/
├── .review/
│   └── extension.md         ← auto-detected by this skill
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── pr-review.yml    ← CI workflow uses the same file
```

**Option B — `.github/ai-pr-reviewer/extension.md`** (fallback if you
prefer keeping the file next to your workflows).

The **same file** should be referenced from your CI workflow's
`prompt-extension-file:` input so local and CI stay in perfect sync:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-review.yml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    prompt-extension-file: .review/extension.md   # same file the skill auto-detects
```

Example `.review/extension.md`:

```markdown
## Severity overrides for our codebase

- Any `SELECT * FROM users` in a request path is **critical** (PII exposure).
- Missing `AbortController` on a `fetch()` in `apps/frontend/` is **warning**
  (React 18 pattern we standardized on in RFC-014).

## Don't comment on

- Formatting in `apps/legacy/*` — that module is scheduled for a rewrite.
- Missing tests in `experiments/` — that folder is intentionally exploratory.
```

## Notes

- **The skill runs your local agent — it doesn't invoke a separate
  LLM.** If your harness is Cursor and you're on `auto`, the review costs
  are billed to your Cursor Pro subscription. If your harness is Claude
  Code with an API key, it's Anthropic tokens. Either way the local
  review is a "free bonus" if you were going to use the agent anyway.
- **This skill does not replace the CI action.** CI still runs on every
  PR and posts the authoritative review (inline comments, severity
  gating, merge-blocking). The skill is for the "before pushing" moment.
- **Extension parity is guaranteed on your side, not enforced by
  tooling.** If your `.review/extension.md` says something different
  from what your CI workflow's `prompt-extension-file:` points at, you
  get drift. Keep them at the same path.
- **Bugs, feature requests, and extension patterns to add to the
  starter templates:**
