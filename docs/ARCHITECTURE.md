# Architecture

A high-level walk-through of how AI Diff Reviewer is put together. For input/output configuration see the [README](../README.md); this doc is for contributors who need a mental model of the runtime and the two surfaces we ship on.

## Two surfaces, one methodology

The product ships on **two disjoint surfaces from the same repository**:

1. **The GitHub Action** — `action.yml` + `scripts/reviewer.py`, invoked by a consumer's workflow via `uses: DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer@v1`. This is the CI-time reviewer.
2. **The local companion skill** — [`skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`](../skills/ai-diff-reviewer/SKILL.md), installed into a consumer repo via `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer --skill ai-diff-reviewer`. This is the pre-push local reviewer that runs inside the developer's coding agent.

Both surfaces share the same [`prompts/default.md`](../prompts/default.md) as the review methodology and the same [`.review/extension.md`](../.review/extension.md) convention for repo-specific overrides. **Two CI invariants keep the parity real**: (a) the `Skills — prompt-sync invariant` job in [`code_check.yml`](../.github/workflows/code_check.yml) fails PRs where the skill's `prompt.md` byte-copy has drifted from `prompts/default.md`; (b) [`auto-release.yml`](../.github/workflows/auto-release.yml) re-syncs the copy AND bumps the skill's frontmatter `version:` field on every release cut so `@v1.5.0` on both surfaces ships the same review methodology.

```

## Components

### `action.yml`

The public contract. Declares every input the consumer can set and every output the consumer can read. The composite-action `runs:` block invokes `scripts/reviewer.py` with all inputs forwarded as `AIPRR_*` environment variables, preceded by one conditional install step per agent-runner CLI provider (each guarded by `if: inputs.provider == '...'` so `provider: anthropic` pays zero install cost).

**Why composite, not Docker:** Docker actions add ~30s of pull time and a second supply chain (the image registry) for zero benefit — the runtime is stdlib Python, which is already on every `ubuntu-latest` runner.

**Why composite, not JS:** the implementation is Python; rewriting to JS would double the maintenance surface. JS actions are appropriate for actions that run on Windows runners (we don't claim to support those).

### `scripts/reviewer.py`

The entire runtime in one file (~4000 LOC, fully type-hinted, stdlib-only). Sections, in source order:

1. **Constants** — every magic number is a named module-level constant. URLs, timeouts, retry delays, severity ranks.
2. **Logging utilities** — `log()`, `redact_for_log()`, `truncate_for_tool()`. The redaction list is the gate that prevents accidental token leakage in tool-arg logging.
3. **GitHub API helpers** — `gh_request`, `gh_graphql`, `gh_post_issue_comment`, `gh_apply_label`, `gh_collapse_previous_reviews`, `gh_submit_review`, `gh_submit_review_with_fallback`. Pure stdlib `urllib`; no `requests`, no `gh` CLI.
4. **Provider abstraction** — Two peers: `Provider` (chat-completions family; action owns the tool-use loop) and `AgentRunnerProvider` (agent-runner family; vendor CLI owns the tool-use loop, communicates via `.aiprr/findings.json`). `AnthropicProvider` is the shipping `Provider`; `ClaudeCodeProvider`, `CursorProvider`, `CodexProvider` are the shipping `AgentRunnerProvider`s. `build_provider()` returns either type; `main()` dispatches via `isinstance`.
5. **PR context** — `PRContext` dataclass + `fetch_pr_context()`. Pulls metadata + the unified diff as the agentic loop's seed user message.
6. **Tool definitions** — `tools_schema()` and the per-tool implementations. Five core tools are always exposed on the chat-completions path (`tool_read_file`, `tool_grep`, `tool_glob`, `tool_post_inline_comment`, `tool_submit_review`); two more are exposed conditionally (`tool_set_pr_description` only in `pr-description-mode: autocomplete`, `tool_set_pr_complexity` only when `complexity-labels-enabled` — see [PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md](PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md)). Each tool implementation handles its own errors and returns a string for the `tool_result`.
7. **Severity / strictness** — `overall_severity()` aggregates the per-comment severities; `evaluate_strictness()` maps `(severity, strictness)` to a blocking decision.
8. **Agentic loop** — `drive_review()`. Drives `provider.complete()` in a loop, executes any tools the model calls, prunes conversation history in pairs to bound token cost, terminates when the model calls `submit_review` or hits the turn cap.
9. **Tracking comment renderers** — `render_tracking_body_working/done/failed`. Pure functions; emit the marker.
10. **`main()`** — orchestrates the lifecycle: load env, label gate, collapse, tracking, prompt resolution, agentic loop (wrapped in failure-update guards), review submission, label application, strictness gate, action outputs.

### `prompts/default.md`

The bundled default system prompt. Technology-agnostic; opinionated about severity definitions and what *not* to comment on. Consumers can override entirely via the `prompt-file` input, or layer stack-specific rules on top via `prompt-extension-file` (CI) / `.review/extension.md` (local skill). The **same file** drives both surfaces — the skill's [`prompt.md`](../skills/ai-diff-reviewer/prompt.md) is a byte-identical copy validated by the `Skills — prompt-sync invariant` CI job.

### `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` — the local companion skill pack

Sibling deliverable to the GitHub Action. Installed into a consumer repo via `npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-diff-reviewer --skill ai-diff-reviewer` — a one-liner that vendors the skill into `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` and records the pinned version in the consumer's `skills-lock.json`.

**Package layout:**

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Parent skill — Open Agent Skills frontmatter + activation triggers + trust boundary + router logic. Runs the default "review the current branch's diff" flow when no sub-skill is invoked. |
| `prompt.md` | Byte-identical copy of `prompts/default.md`. Sync enforced by CI + auto-release. |
| `generate-extension/SKILL.md` | Sub-skill that authors a tailored `.review/extension.md` after ≥12 Discovery tool calls into the target repo. |
| `generate-extension/examples.md` | Condensed sample outputs for the extension generator. |
| `setup/SKILL.md` | Sub-skill that installs the GitHub Action in a repo that doesn't have it yet — six-question wizard writes `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` tailored to the repo. |
| `setup/reference.md` | Reference manual for every `action.yml` input (description, default, choices, per-scenario recommendations) — any coding agent with the skill installed can answer input-reference questions without opening the action source. Must stay in sync with `action.yml` (pre-commit checklist item). |
| `open-pr/SKILL.md` | Sub-skill that authors a well-documented PR title + body from the current branch's diff and executes via `gh pr create`/`edit`. Merges with `.github/pull_request_template.md` when present. |
| `apply-review/SKILL.md` | Sub-skill that closes the CI-back-to-local loop — reads the live AI review on the PR (filters `isMinimized: true` collapsed history + non-bot noise via a GraphQL query documented in [`docs/PR_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`](PR_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md)), presents findings in the same shape a local review would print, and walks apply / defer / skip per finding. Never commits, never pushes; edits source files only under per-finding *"apply"* consent with pre-image safety derived from `git show <marker-sha>:<path>` at the reviewed commit (`diffHunk` is a secondary consistency check; GraphQL has no `side` field on `PullRequestReviewComment`, and the sub-skill defaults to RIGHT because `findings_to_gh_inline_comments()` in `scripts/reviewer.py` posts anchors with `side: RIGHT`). |

**Design constraints for the skill pack:**

1. **Zero LLM calls of its own.** Every LLM interaction happens inside the developer's coding agent. This is what makes the skill zero-cost to install (no API key round-trip) and provider-agnostic.
2. **Read-only by default.** The parent review flow only reads. Every sub-skill that writes files asks for explicit consent first.
3. **Non-blocking on failure.** If the skill can't run (missing `gh` CLI, no git remote, corrupted diff), it prints a clear error and exits — the developer's primary work is never blocked.
4. **Symmetric with the Action.** Same base prompt, same severity model, same `.review/extension.md` extension convention, same output format. Pinning the same version on both surfaces guarantees identical review behaviour.

**Dogfooding contract:** this repo vendors its own skill copy at [`.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/`](../.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/), refreshed automatically by [`auto-release.yml`](../.github/workflows/auto-release.yml) Step 3.5 after every release. A skill change that ships broken `npx skills add` compatibility fails Step 3.5 of the very release that publishes it.

## Key design decisions

### 1. Stdlib only

The biggest constraint and the biggest feature. Means consumers can install the action with a single `uses:` and never think about a `pip install` step or a Docker pull. Forces the codebase to stay small and audit-friendly.

### 2. Anthropic-shaped in-memory representation

The agentic loop stores messages in Anthropic's content-block format (`{role, content: [{type: "text", ...}, {type: "tool_use", ...}]}`). When we add OpenAI we translate at the provider boundary rather than abstract upward. The trade-off:

- **Pro:** simpler runtime; only one shape to reason about.
- **Con:** the OpenAI provider has more translation work than a hypothetical OpenAI-native runtime would.

For a tool-use agentic loop, the per-turn translation cost is trivial; the runtime simplicity dominates.

### 3. Inline comments queued in memory, posted atomically

The `post_inline_comment` tool doesn't actually call GitHub — it appends to `ReviewState.inline_comments`. Submission happens once, in `gh_submit_review_with_fallback`, with summary + comments in a single `POST /pulls/{n}/reviews`.

**Why:** GitHub's per-comment endpoint (`POST /pulls/{n}/comments`) creates one separate review per call. Batching into a single review keeps the PR conversation tab clean (one entry, not 30) and matches the model's mental model of "one review with N comments".

**Trade-off:** if any one comment has an invalid `line` (anchor outside the diff), GitHub rejects the entire review with HTTP 422. The action handles this with a fallback path: catch 422, retry summary-only, log the original error body, surface the dropped count in the tracking comment.

### 4. Conversation pruning in pairs

The agentic loop prunes conversation history when it grows past `MAX_CONVERSATION_TURNS_RETAINED * 2 + 1` messages. The pruning is in **pairs** (one assistant message + the matching tool_results) rather than one message at a time, because Anthropic's API rejects orphan `tool_use_id`s — a pruned `tool_use` block whose matching `tool_result` is still in the history (or vice versa) crashes the next turn.

### 5. Failure paths always update the tracking comment

The tracking comment is the single source of truth for "what happened to this review". Every error path in `main()` either:
- Updates the tracking comment with a `failed` body before returning a non-zero exit code, OR
- Logs and re-raises so the broad-except wrapper at the top of `main()` does the update.

A "stuck on Working…" tracking comment is a regression; if you add an error path, make sure it transitions the spinner.

### 6. Strictness exits 2, not 1

- Exit 0 — success.
- Exit 2 — the strictness gate blocked the check.
- Exit 1 — hard failure (auth error, prompt file missing, etc.).

Distinguishing 1 from 2 lets the consumer's workflow `if:` clauses tell "the bot didn't run" from "the bot ran and decided this PR shouldn't merge".

### 7. Prompt caching

The Anthropic provider sends the system prompt with `cache_control: ephemeral` so a long custom prompt only pays the full token cost on the first turn of each review. Subsequent turns within the same review (and within the ~5-minute cache TTL) read from cache. This is what makes long, opinionated prompts economically viable.

### 8. Two provider families (v1.1.0+)

The runtime supports two disjoint provider families, unified by the `ReviewResult` dataclass:

**Chat-completions (`Provider`)** — the action owns the tool-use loop:
- Calls the vendor's messages/completions endpoint directly.
- Executes tool calls (`read_file`, `grep`, `glob`, `post_inline_comment`, `submit_review`) from `scripts/reviewer.py` in-process.
- Pros: zero install overhead for consumers; deterministic tool set; direct control.
- Cons: reinvents the wheel of code comprehension; no LSP; no vendor-tuned coding-agent prompt.
- Shipping: `AnthropicProvider` (`provider: anthropic`).

**Agent-runner (`AgentRunnerProvider`)** — the vendor's coding-agent CLI owns the tool-use loop:
- Subprocess-invokes the CLI in headless mode with the layered prompt.
- CLI runs its own agentic loop with vendor-tuned tools (LSP-backed navigation, semantic search, MCP).
- Communicates back via the file-based `.aiprr/findings.json` contract (schema in [PROVIDERS.md](PROVIDERS.md)).
- Pros: better code comprehension out of the box; MCP passthrough; vendor keeps their tool set current.
- Cons: install step on the runner; larger LOC-per-review cost since the CLI can spend more turns.
- Shipping: `ClaudeCodeProvider`, `CursorProvider`, `CodexProvider`.

**Convergence point:** both families produce a `ReviewResult(summary, findings, overall_severity)` that flows into the SAME submission path (`gh_submit_review_with_fallback` — accepts a `ReviewResult`, encodes findings into the GitHub Reviews inline shape at the boundary). This means the strictness gate, tracking comment renderers, and action outputs are provider-agnostic.

### 9. Modular CLI install (v1.1.0+)

The composite action's `runs.steps` list contains ONE install step per CLI provider, each guarded by `if: inputs.provider == '...'`. Consumers picking `provider: anthropic` (the default) see zero install overhead. Consumers picking `provider: cursor` see only the Cursor Agent installer run, etc. No consumer ever has all three CLIs installed on their runner.

Each install step:
1. Sets up its runtime dependency (Node.js for Claude Code and Codex; nothing for Cursor).
2. Runs the vendor's install command, optionally pinned via the corresponding `*-version` input.
3. Emits a `--version` line as a smoke assertion — if the binary is not on PATH, the composite step fails loudly here instead of the reviewer's `install()` sanity check firing 20 lines later.

### 10. Iteration-Aware Review — a cross-cutting subsystem (v1.6.0+, opt-in)

Iteration-Aware Review (IAR) is a subsystem that wraps the reviewer's main loop with a state layer, a generation-tracking layer, a content-anchored deduplication engine, and four convergence policies. It is **opt-in** (default off) and every code path is gated on `iar_config.enabled` at the call site, so consumers who don't enable it get byte-identical behavior to prior releases (enforced by the 19-test regression suite `tests/test_backward_compat_iar_off.py`).

**Read/write flow per review run (when enabled):**

└── (post-LLM outputs)                ← write_iar_outputs_populated() over the empty
                                        defaults from write_all_outputs
```

**Load-bearing invariants:**

- **Zero external state.** The IterationState JSON lives inside the tracking marker's HTML comment. No new file on disk, no new API surface, no new database.
- **Critical safety rail.** `dedupe_findings_against_prior()` unconditionally surfaces any `severity == critical` finding, regardless of policy or prior state. This branch is HARDCODED inside the dedup function and MUST NOT be moved into a policy, made configurable, or bypassed. Every convergence policy funnels through this function precisely so the rail cannot be forgotten.
- **Never crashes the reviewer.** Both `run_iar_pre_llm` and `run_iar_post_llm` are wrapped in `try/except` at the call site in `main()`. On any IAR failure the reviewer falls back to the baseline (IAR-off) path and logs the exception — the CI check still gets a review, IAR just skips this run.
- **Escape label = zero state mutation.** When the user applies the escape label to a PR, dispatch_policy surfaces every finding without dedup AND `run_iar_post_llm` returns the prior state unchanged. The next normal run resumes the dedup timeline as if the escape never happened.

| Local companion skill | `skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` (source of truth for consumers) + `.agents/skills/ai-diff-reviewer/` (vendored dogfood copy, refreshed by `auto-release.yml` Step 3.5) |
| Prompt-sync + skill-install CI invariants | `code_check.yml` (`Skills — prompt-sync invariant`), `auto-release.yml` Step 3.5 (`npx skills update` smoke) |
| CI strategy | `.github/workflows/code_check.yml`, `.github/workflows/self-review.yml` |
| Release strategy | `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `CHANGELOG.md` |
| AI-agent configuration | `.agents/` (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)) |

## What we deliberately don't have

- **No `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml`.** Stdlib only; no version pin file because there's nothing to pin.
- **No unit-test framework.** The testing strategy is `py_compile` + dogfooding (see [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md)). Adding `pytest` is a real cost (more deps, more CI time, more contributor overhead) for a script whose meaningful tests are integrations against external APIs.
- **No `setup.py` / package install.** This is a GitHub Action, not a library. Consumers `uses:` it; nobody `pip install`s it.
- **No Sentry, no telemetry, no analytics.** Logs go to the workflow log; there's no phone-home.
- **No plugin system.** The provider abstraction is the only extension point; adding new ones is a code change in this repo, not a runtime hook.
