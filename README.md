# AI PR Reviewer

> An LLM-driven pull-request reviewer as a GitHub Action — inline comments, severity-based gating, no infrastructure.

[![Powered by Dailybot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20by-Dailybot-6C5CE7.svg)](https://www.dailybot.com?utm_source=dailybotopensource&utm_medium=ai-pr-reviewer)

A composite GitHub Action that runs a real code review on every pull request: posts inline comments, marks previous reviews as outdated, gates the GitHub check based on configurable strictness, and applies a "reviewed" label. Stdlib-only Python — no Docker image to pull, no Node modules, no infrastructure beyond your provider's API key.

Originally built to replace [`anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) when its `restoreConfigFromBase` step started crashing on repos that ship `.claude` as a symlink. The action solves that problem and a few more — same review quality, more configuration knobs, friendlier failure modes.

## Quick start

Drop this into `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: PR review
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    types: [opened, synchronize]

concurrency:
  group: pr-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0   # required: the action uses `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`
      - uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's the minimum. Open a PR; the action posts a tracking comment, runs a review, and updates the comment with the result.

---

## What you get out of the box

- **Inline comments** anchored to specific lines, with optional GitHub suggestion blocks (one-click apply).
- **Tracking comment** with a `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->` marker that transitions in-place from `Working…` → `View review →`.
- **Auto-collapse** of *this provider's* previous reviews on every new push, scoped by a per-provider marker — leaves other bots' comments (coverage, labelers) and other-provider reviews alone, so multi-provider dogfooding on the same PR just works.
- **Severity-based gating**: the model assigns `critical` / `warning` / `info` to each finding; you decide what fails the check.
- **Optional label gate**: only run when a PR carries a label (e.g. `ready`).
- **Optional "reviewed" label**: applied automatically after a successful, non-blocked review.
- **Self-healing on GitHub 422**: if the model anchors a comment outside the diff, the action retries summary-only instead of losing every other comment.

---

## Providers

The action ships **four LLM providers** in two families. Pick one with the `provider` input; `api-key` always carries the credential for the chosen provider. The default (`anthropic`) needs no CLI install; the three agent-runner CLIs are installed automatically by the action only when you select them.

| `provider` | Family | `api-key` value | Default model | Billing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` *(default)* | chat-completions | Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-api…`) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | metered API |
| `claude-code` | agent-runner CLI | Anthropic API key **or** a `claude setup-token` token (`sk-ant-oat…`) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | metered API **or** Claude Pro/Max subscription |
| `cursor` | agent-runner CLI | Cursor subscription key | `auto` | Cursor subscription (unlimited on Pro) |
| `codex` | agent-runner CLI | OpenAI API key | `gpt-5.6-luna` | metered API |

- **`anthropic`** is the simplest and cheapest to run — no install, a bounded tool-use loop, prompt caching. Recommended for most repos.
- **The CLI providers** hand the review to a vendor coding agent (deeper code comprehension, vendor-tuned tools) at the cost of an install step and higher token use. They run with broad local access — on public repos use them only on trusted (non-fork) PRs.

### Switching provider

```yaml
# Cursor — flat-rate on Pro
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    provider: cursor
    api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

```yaml
# OpenAI Codex
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    provider: codex
    api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Ready-to-copy workflows per provider: [`examples/provider-claude-code.yml`](examples/provider-claude-code.yml), [`examples/provider-cursor.yml`](examples/provider-cursor.yml), [`examples/provider-codex.yml`](examples/provider-codex.yml).

### Bill Claude Code against a subscription (instead of API tokens)

Like Cursor, `claude-code` can bill against a **Claude Pro/Max subscription**. Run `claude setup-token` on a machine logged into your plan, store the resulting `sk-ant-oat…` token as a secret, and pass it as `api-key` — the action auto-detects the prefix and uses subscription auth:

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    provider: claude-code
    api-key: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}   # sk-ant-oat… subscription token
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

> **Security:** a subscription token grants broader account access than a scoped API key. On public repos, use the CLI providers only on trusted (non-fork) PRs and set `persist-credentials: false` on `actions/checkout`. Full details: [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md) and [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api-key` | ✅ | — | Provider API key. For Anthropic this is your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| `github-token` | ✅ | — | Token with `pull-requests: write` and `contents: read`. The default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` works; pass a PAT or automation-bot token if you want the review attributed to a specific account. |
| `provider` | | `anthropic` | LLM provider. `anthropic` (chat-completions), `claude-code` / `cursor` / `codex` (agent-runner CLIs). See [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md). |
| `model` | | provider default | Model id (defaults balance review quality vs cost). Anthropic → `claude-sonnet-4-6`, Claude Code → `claude-sonnet-4-6` (never `auto`; Claude Code's `api-key` also accepts a `claude setup-token` subscription token, `sk-ant-oat…`), Cursor → `auto` (flat-rate on Pro), Codex → `gpt-5.6-luna` (`gpt-5-codex` is deprecated). See [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md#choosing-a-cost-efficient-model). |
| `prompt-file` | | bundled `prompts/default.md` | Path **inside the consumer checkout** to a markdown system prompt. FULLY REPLACES the base. Customising the prompt is the main lever for adapting the review to your codebase — see [docs/PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md). |
| `prompt-extension-file` | | _(empty)_ | Path **inside the consumer checkout** to a markdown file APPENDED to the base prompt. Use to layer overrides without copying the whole default. Combines with `prompt-file` (base + extension). Starter templates in [`examples/prompts/`](examples/prompts/). |
| `author-association` | | `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR` | Comma-separated whitelist of GitHub `pull_request.author_association` values allowed to trigger a review. Default is write-tier only — the safe baseline for public open-source repos (prevents external-contributor PR spam from burning your LLM budget). Add `CONTRIBUTOR` to allow returning contributors, or set to empty string to disable the gate. See [docs/SECURITY.md § "Author-association gate"](docs/SECURITY.md). |
| `label-gate` | | `''` | If non-empty, the review only runs when the PR carries this label (e.g. `ready`). Combined with `trigger-mode`. |
| `trigger-mode` | | _(auto)_ | `always` / `label-required` / `label-once` / `label-added-only` — see [docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md). Empty picks `label-required` when `label-gate` is set, else `always`. |
| `applied-label` | | `''` | If non-empty, this label is applied to the PR after a successful, non-blocked review (e.g. `pr-reviewed`). The label is auto-created if it doesn't exist. |
| `collapse-previous` | | `true` | Mark previous bot reviews/comments as `OUTDATED` via GraphQL `minimizeComment`. |
| `tracking-comment` | | `true` | Post a spinner comment that transitions to the final review URL. |
| `strictness` | | `lenient` | `lenient` / `block-on-critical` / `block-on-warning` / `block-on-any` — see [docs/STRICTNESS.md](docs/STRICTNESS.md). |
| `max-inline-comments` | | `10` | Hard cap on inline comments per review. |
| `pr-description-mode` | | `off` | `off` / `warn` / `block` / `autocomplete` — see [docs/PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md](docs/PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md). |
| `pr-description-min-length` | | `50` | Char threshold below which the PR body is treated as vague. |
| `complexity-labels-enabled` | | `false` | When `true`, the reviewer applies a `complexity:low/medium/high` label to the PR. |
| `complexity-label-prefix` | | `complexity:` | Prefix for the complexity label (change to match your labeling conventions). |
| `max-turns` | | `30` | Hard cap on the agentic-loop iterations (chat-completions providers only). |
| `agent-max-turns` | | `''` | Reserved budget hint for CLI providers. Currently logs a warning instead of enforcing a cap because the shipping CLIs do not expose one stable cross-provider turn-count flag. Ignored for chat-completions providers. |
| `agent-extra-args` | | `''` | Raw string appended to the CLI invocation. Parsed with `shlex.split` (never `shell=True`). Escape hatch for provider-specific flags. |
| `mcp-config-file` | | `''` | Path inside the consumer checkout to an MCP servers JSON config. If set, the file is copied to the CLI's expected location before invocation. |
| `claude-code-version` | | `''` | Pin the Claude Code CLI version (npm semver). Empty = latest. |
| `cursor-version` | | `''` | Pin the Cursor Agent CLI version. Empty = latest stable. |
| `codex-version` | | `''` | Pin the OpenAI Codex CLI version (npm semver). Empty = latest. |

## Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `review-url` | string | URL of the posted PR review (empty on skip). |
| `severity` | `none` \| `info` \| `warning` \| `critical` | Highest severity flagged. |
| `inline-attached` | int | Inline comments actually attached. |
| `inline-dropped` | int | Inline comments dropped because GitHub returned 422. |
| `blocked` | bool | Whether strictness blocked the check. When `true`, the action exits with code 2. |
| `skipped` | bool | Whether the run was skipped (label/author gate). |

Consume them in a later step by giving the action step an `id`:

```yaml
      - id: review
        uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - if: steps.review.outputs.severity == 'critical'
        run: echo "Critical findings — see ${{ steps.review.outputs.review-url }}"
```

---

## Strictness levels

| Mode | What fails the check |
|---|---|
| `lenient` (default) | Nothing. The review posts; the check is always green. |
| `block-on-critical` | One or more inline comments tagged `critical`. |
| `block-on-warning` | One or more inline comments tagged `critical` or `warning`. |
| `block-on-any` | Any inline comment at all, including `info`. Zero-tolerance mode — use for security-critical or regulated stacks where every finding must be resolved before merge. |

The model decides severity per inline comment via the tool's `severity` argument; the bundled default prompt explains the levels in detail. Customise the prompt to make the model more or less aggressive about each tier.

Full guide: [docs/STRICTNESS.md](docs/STRICTNESS.md).

## Controlling cost & access

Every review spends tokens, so the action layers three controls, evaluated **cheapest-first** — a denied gate costs **zero API calls**:

**1. Who can trigger a review — `author-association`** (default `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR` = write-tier only). This is evaluated **first**, before the diff is even fetched, so an outsider opening PRs from a fork can never burn your budget — the field comes from GitHub's webhook payload and can't be spoofed.

| Want to… | Set |
|---|---|
| Only people with write access (default, safe for public repos) | `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR` |
| Also allow returning contributors | `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR,CONTRIBUTOR` |
| Only org members | `OWNER,MEMBER` |
| Review **every** PR (e.g. private repos) | `''` (empty) |

**2. When it runs — `label-gate` + `trigger-mode`:**

| Behaviour | Set |
|---|---|
| Every push (default) | `trigger-mode: always` |
| Only when the PR has a label | `label-gate: ready` (matching is **case-insensitive**: `ready`/`Ready`/`READY`) |
| Only once per label application (re-run by toggling the label off/on) | `label-gate: ready` + `trigger-mode: label-once` |
| Only on the moment the label is added | `trigger-mode: label-added-only` (workflow must subscribe with `types: [labeled]`) |

**3. How much each run spends — `model`, `max-inline-comments`, `max-turns`:**

- Defaults are **quality-tier** for real reviews (Sonnet-class / current-gen). Pin a cheaper model for smoke passes (`model: claude-haiku-4-5` or `gpt-5.4-mini`), or use `provider: cursor` for flat-rate cost on Pro. See [docs/PROVIDERS.md § "Choosing a cost-efficient model"](docs/PROVIDERS.md#choosing-a-cost-efficient-model).
- `max-inline-comments` (default `10`) caps how many comments a run can post; `max-turns` (default `30`, chat-completions only) is a safety ceiling on the agentic loop.

These compose. For a public open-source repo the safe combination is author-association (default) **+** a label gate — see the [recipe below](#public-open-source-repo-safest-defaults).

Threat model & full detail: [docs/SECURITY.md § "Author-association gate"](docs/SECURITY.md), [docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md).

## Recipes

### Run only on PRs labelled `ready`, apply `pr-reviewed` on success

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    label-gate: ready
    applied-label: pr-reviewed
```

### Block merge on critical findings

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    strictness: block-on-critical
```

Pair with a branch protection rule that requires the PR-review check to pass.

### Require a passing review before merge (branch protection)

Marking the review job **Required** in branch protection is *not enough* on its own: GitHub treats a required check in the **Skipped** state as **passing**, so a label-gated PR that never triggered a review still merges freely. To make "no review ⇒ no merge" real, gate the merge on a small **stable-named** job that *fails* (rather than skips) when the review didn't run — then require only that job:

```yaml
jobs:
  # … your review job (may be skipped when no label / non-critical diff) …
  review-gate:
    name: 'Review gate'          # ← mark ONLY this as the required check
    needs: [review]
    if: always()                 # report even when `review` was skipped
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - shell: bash
        run: |
          [ "${{ needs.review.result }}" = "success" ] || {
            echo "::error::No passing review — apply the label to trigger it, then merge."; exit 1; }
```

A *failing* required check blocks the merge; a *skipped* one does not. With **several** review legs (a provider matrix), the reference implementation passes the gate when **at least one** leg ran and passed — so one flaky provider can't block a merge another provider approved. Full walkthrough (single-provider + dynamic matrix + the "≥1 passed" count): [docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md § "Recipe: run once when labelled `ready`, block merge until it passes"](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md). This repo's own [`.github/workflows/self-review.yml`](.github/workflows/self-review.yml) is the reference implementation.

### Custom prompt for your codebase

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    # Full replacement:
    prompt-file: .github/prompts/our_house_rules.md
    # Or layer overrides on top of whichever base is loaded (default OR
    # a custom `prompt-file`). Both inputs may be used together — see
    # docs/PROMPTS.md for the "base vs extension vs replacement" guide:
    # prompt-extension-file: examples/prompts/python-strict.md
```

The prompt is the most powerful knob. See [docs/PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md) for the "Base vs Extension vs Replacement" decision guide, the starter extensions in [`examples/prompts/`](examples/prompts/), and the meta-prompt that lets your favorite AI generate a repo-tailored prompt for you.

### Review-once-per-label workflow

Run only when you signal readiness by adding a label; toggle the label off/on to re-run:

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    trigger-mode: label-once
    label-gate: ai-review
```

Full guide: [docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md). Want unlabeled PRs to show the check as **Skipped** (grey) instead of a green **Success** — and the review to fire only when you apply the label, once per application? See [docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md § "Recipe: run once when labelled `ready`, and show Skipped (not green)"](docs/TRIGGER_MODES.md), the exact pattern this repo's own `self-review.yml` uses.

### Auto-fill missing PR descriptions

Let the reviewer write a first-draft body when the current one is empty or under 50 chars. Guarded by a marker so it never overwrites your edits.

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    pr-description-mode: autocomplete
```

Full guide: [docs/PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md](docs/PR_METADATA_CHECKS.md).

### AI-driven complexity labels

Apply a `complexity:low/medium/high` label based on cognitive load, files touched, and security surface — not line count:

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    complexity-labels-enabled: true
```

### Use a non-default automation account

If you want the review attributed to a specific bot account (e.g. so branch protection rules can require approval from "anyone except the bot"):

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # PAT for your bot account
```

### Public open-source repo (safest defaults)

For a public repo, external contributors can open PRs — and each review costs real money (~50K–200K tokens per PR). The `author-association` input (default `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR`, v1.3.0+) gates reviews on the PR author's relationship to the repo; the field comes from GitHub's payload and cannot be spoofed. Belt-and-suspenders combined with a label gate:

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    author-association: 'OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR,CONTRIBUTOR'  # optional: allow returning contributors
    label-gate: 'ai-review'                                       # maintainer opt-in per PR
    trigger-mode: label-once
```

Result: an outsider opening PRs cannot trigger the review at all (gate fails, zero API calls); returning contributors get a review only when a maintainer applies the `ai-review` label; the review runs exactly once per label application. See [docs/SECURITY.md § "Author-association gate"](docs/SECURITY.md) and [`examples/open-source-safe.yml`](examples/open-source-safe.yml).

More recipes: [`examples/`](examples/).

## Required permissions

The action needs:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

The job-level `timeout-minutes: 15` is recommended — the agentic loop has its own caps but a sane workflow timeout is the final safety net.

`fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout` is **required**: the action runs `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` to produce the diff seed, and a shallow clone won't have the base ref locally.

---

## How it works

1. **Access & trigger gates** (cheapest first, no API calls) — `author-association` runs first (skip if the PR author isn't in the whitelist), then the `label-gate` / `trigger-mode` check (skip if the required label is missing or this label application was already reviewed).
2. **Collapse previous** — marks prior bot reviews/comments as `OUTDATED` via GraphQL.
3. **Tracking comment** — posts a `Working…` comment with a stable marker.
4. **Fetch PR** — pulls metadata, file list, and `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`.
5. **Agentic loop** — runs the model with five tools: `read_file`, `grep`, `glob`, `post_inline_comment`, `submit_review`. Inline comments are queued in memory and posted atomically with the final review. Conversation history is pruned in pairs to bound token cost.
6. **Submit** — `POST /pulls/{n}/reviews` with the summary and queued inline comments. On HTTP 422 (one bad anchor line in any comment ⇒ entire request rejected), the action retries summary-only and reports the dropped count in the tracking comment.
7. **Apply label** — applies `applied-label` if set and the strictness gate didn't block.
8. **Strictness gate** — exits 2 if blocked, 0 otherwise.

For the full design, see [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md), [docs/PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md), [docs/STRICTNESS.md](docs/STRICTNESS.md).

## Local review parity (companion skill)

Run the **same review methodology** the CI action would run — locally, in your coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf) — before you push. Useful for pre-flight checks, iterating on prompt-extension rules, or getting a second opinion on a WIP branch without opening a draft PR.

The companion skill ships alongside the action in this repo (`skills/code-review/`) and installs into any consumer repo with one command:

```bash
npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer --skill code-review
# Or pin to a specific action version for reproducibility:
npx skills add DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1 --skill code-review
```

`npx skills` vendors the skill into `.agents/skills/code-review/` and records the source + content hash in `skills-lock.json` so teammates can restore identical bytes with `npx skills experimental_install`.

Once installed, natural-language triggers activate the review:

- *"Review my current branch"*
- *"Do a pre-flight review before I push"*
- *"What would CI say about my current commits?"*

The skill uses your local agent's own tools (Read / Grep / Glob) to gather context, then produces the review in **the same output format** the CI bot would post — verdict, findings table, per-finding body, notes, recommendation. Because the skill's `prompt.md` is a byte-identical copy of the action's shipped `prompts/default.md` (kept in sync by [`auto-release.yml`](.github/workflows/auto-release.yml)), pinning the same version on both surfaces guarantees local ↔ CI parity.

The skill also ships a **`generate-extension` sub-skill** that bootstraps a repo-tailored `.review/extension.md` for you. Instead of copy-pasting the [meta-prompt](examples/prompts/generate-custom-prompt-meta.md) into a chat window, just say:

- *"Generate a `.review/extension.md` for this repo"*
- *"Customize the code review for our project"*
- *"Set up the AI reviewer for this codebase"*

The sub-skill inspects your stack, architecture, security surface, and existing conventions (≥ 12 tool calls minimum — real Discovery, not a guess), then writes the file directly. Two output modes: **extension** (layered on top of the default — recommended) or **full replacement** (advanced, for teams that want total control). Full details in [`skills/code-review/generate-extension/SKILL.md`](skills/code-review/generate-extension/SKILL.md).

### Sharing repo-specific rules between CI and local

Put your custom overrides in **`.review/extension.md`** at your repo root — the `code-review` skill auto-detects it, and your CI workflow can reference the same file via the action's `prompt-extension-file:` input:

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    prompt-extension-file: .review/extension.md   # same file the skill auto-detects
```

**One file, two surfaces, zero drift.**

**Two provider families:**

- **`Provider`** (chat-completions family) — the action owns the tool-use loop, calling the model's API in a bounded turn count. No install step needed. Zero overhead for consumers.
- **`AgentRunnerProvider`** (agent-runner family) — a vendor's coding-agent CLI owns the tool-use loop; we shell out in headless mode and receive findings via `.aiprr/findings.json`. Better code comprehension (vendor-tuned tools, LSP, semantic search) at the cost of a CLI install step (only when the consumer opts in — modular install; see [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md)).

Adding a new provider means implementing one class and registering it in `build_provider()`. Contributions welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## FAQ

**Why a custom action and not just `anthropics/claude-code-action`?**
That action's `restoreConfigFromBase` step crashes with `ENOENT` on repos that ship `.claude` as a symlink (a common pattern when consolidating multi-agent configs into a shared `.agents/` folder). This action removes that dependency and adds severity-based gating, configurable label gates, and a 422-recovery path the upstream action lacks.

**Why composite, not Docker?**
The reviewer is stdlib-only Python. A Docker action would add ~30s of pull time and a second supply chain (the image registry) for zero benefit.

**Will the model leak my code to the provider?**
The action sends the PR diff and any files the model `read_file`s to the configured provider. Treat it like any other LLM integration — review your provider's data-retention policy and use a self-hosted runner if you have specific constraints.

**Does it work on private repos?**
Yes. The default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` has the right scope; just make sure the repo's settings allow Actions to read content and write PR comments.

**Can I dogfood the reviewer on its own PRs?**
Yes — see `.github/workflows/self-review.yml` in this repo for the pattern.
