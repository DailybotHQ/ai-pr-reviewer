# AI PR Reviewer

> An LLM-driven pull-request reviewer as a GitHub Action — inline comments, severity-based gating, no infrastructure.

A composite GitHub Action that runs a real code review on every pull request: posts inline comments, marks previous reviews as outdated, gates the GitHub check based on configurable strictness, and applies a "reviewed" label. Stdlib-only Python — no Docker image to pull, no Node modules, no infrastructure beyond your provider's API key.

Originally built to replace [`anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) when its `restoreConfigFromBase` step started crashing on repos that ship `.claude` as a symlink. The action solves that problem and a few more — same review quality, more configuration knobs, friendlier failure modes.

## Quick start

Drop this into `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: PR review
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    types: [opened, synchronize]

concurrency:
  group: pr-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0   # required: the action uses `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`
      - uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's the minimum. Open a PR; the action posts a tracking comment, runs a review, and updates the comment with the result.

---

## What you get out of the box

- **Inline comments** anchored to specific lines, with optional GitHub suggestion blocks (one-click apply).
- **Tracking comment** with a `<!-- ai-pr-reviewer-marker -->` marker that transitions in-place from `Working…` → `View review →`.
- **Auto-collapse** of previous bot reviews on every new push (no comment-spam noise from older commits).
- **Severity-based gating**: the model assigns `critical` / `warning` / `info` to each finding; you decide what fails the check.
- **Optional label gate**: only run when a PR carries a label (e.g. `ready`).
- **Optional "reviewed" label**: applied automatically after a successful, non-blocked review.
- **Self-healing on GitHub 422**: if the model anchors a comment outside the diff, the action retries summary-only instead of losing every other comment.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api-key` | ✅ | — | Provider API key. For Anthropic this is your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| `github-token` | ✅ | — | Token with `pull-requests: write` and `contents: read`. The default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` works; pass a PAT or automation-bot token if you want the review attributed to a specific account. |
| `provider` | | `anthropic` | LLM provider. `anthropic` (chat-completions), `claude-code` / `cursor` / `codex` (agent-runner CLIs). See [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md). |
| `model` | | provider default | Model id. Anthropic → `claude-sonnet-4-6`, Cursor → `composer-2.5`, Codex → `gpt-5-codex`, Claude Code → account default. |
| `prompt-file` | | bundled `prompts/default.md` | Path **inside the consumer checkout** to a markdown system prompt. FULLY REPLACES the base. Customising the prompt is the main lever for adapting the review to your codebase — see [docs/PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md). |
| `prompt-extension-file` | | _(empty)_ | Path **inside the consumer checkout** to a markdown file APPENDED to the base prompt. Use to layer overrides without copying the whole default. Combines with `prompt-file` (base + extension). Starter templates in [`examples/prompts/`](examples/prompts/). |
| `label-gate` | | `''` | If non-empty, the review only runs when the PR carries this label (e.g. `ready`). |
| `applied-label` | | `''` | If non-empty, this label is applied to the PR after a successful, non-blocked review (e.g. `pr-reviewed`). The label is auto-created if it doesn't exist. |
| `collapse-previous` | | `true` | Mark previous bot reviews/comments as `OUTDATED` via GraphQL `minimizeComment`. |
| `tracking-comment` | | `true` | Post a spinner comment that transitions to the final review URL. |
| `strictness` | | `lenient` | `lenient` / `block-on-critical` / `block-on-warning` / `block-on-any` — see [docs/STRICTNESS.md](docs/STRICTNESS.md). |
| `max-inline-comments` | | `10` | Hard cap on inline comments per review. |
| `max-turns` | | `30` | Hard cap on the agentic-loop iterations (chat-completions providers only). |
| `agent-max-turns` | | `''` | Cap on the CLI provider's internal turn count. Empty = provider default. Ignored for chat-completions providers. |
| `agent-extra-args` | | `''` | Raw string appended to the CLI invocation. Parsed with `shlex.split` (never `shell=True`). Escape hatch for provider-specific flags. |
| `mcp-config-file` | | `''` | Path inside the consumer checkout to an MCP servers JSON config. If set, the file is copied to the CLI's expected location before invocation. |
| `claude-code-version` | | `''` | Pin the Claude Code CLI version (npm semver). Empty = latest. |
| `cursor-version` | | `''` | Pin the Cursor Agent CLI version. Empty = latest stable. |
| `codex-version` | | `''` | Pin the OpenAI Codex CLI version (npm semver). Empty = latest. |

## Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `review-url` | string | URL of the posted PR review (empty on skip). |
| `severity` | `none` \| `info` \| `warning` \| `critical` | Highest severity flagged. |
| `inline-attached` | int | Inline comments actually attached. |
| `inline-dropped` | int | Inline comments dropped because GitHub returned 422. |
| `blocked` | bool | Whether strictness blocked the check. When `true`, the action exits with code 2. |
| `skipped` | bool | Whether the run was skipped by the label gate. |

---

## Strictness levels

| Mode | What fails the check |
|---|---|
| `lenient` (default) | Nothing. The review posts; the check is always green. |
| `block-on-critical` | One or more inline comments tagged `critical`. |
| `block-on-warning` | One or more inline comments tagged `critical` or `warning`. |
| `block-on-any` | Any inline comment at all, including `info`. Zero-tolerance mode — use for security-critical or regulated stacks where every finding must be resolved before merge. |

The model decides severity per inline comment via the tool's `severity` argument; the bundled default prompt explains the levels in detail. Customise the prompt to make the model more or less aggressive about each tier.

## Recipes

### Run only on PRs labelled `ready`, apply `pr-reviewed` on success

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    label-gate: ready
    applied-label: pr-reviewed
```

### Block merge on critical findings

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    strictness: block-on-critical
```

Pair with a branch protection rule that requires the PR-review check to pass.

### Custom prompt for your codebase

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    prompt-file: .github/prompts/our_house_rules.md
```

The prompt is the most powerful knob. See [docs/PROMPTS.md](docs/PROMPTS.md) for what good prompts look like (severity definitions, project-specific anti-patterns, "don't comment on" lists, etc.).

### Use a non-default automation account

If you want the review attributed to a specific bot account (e.g. so branch protection rules can require approval from "anyone except the bot"):

```yaml
- uses: DailybotHQ/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMATION_GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # PAT for your bot account
```

More recipes: [`examples/`](examples/).

---

## Required permissions

The action needs:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

The job-level `timeout-minutes: 15` is recommended — the agentic loop has its own caps but a sane workflow timeout is the final safety net.

`fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout` is **required**: the action runs `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD` to produce the diff seed, and a shallow clone won't have the base ref locally.

---

## How it works

1. **Label gate** — early-exits if `label-gate` is set and missing.
2. **Collapse previous** — marks prior bot reviews/comments as `OUTDATED` via GraphQL.
3. **Tracking comment** — posts a `Working…` comment with a stable marker.
4. **Fetch PR** — pulls metadata, file list, and `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`.
5. **Agentic loop** — runs the model with five tools: `read_file`, `grep`, `glob`, `post_inline_comment`, `submit_review`. Inline comments are queued in memory and posted atomically with the final review. Conversation history is pruned in pairs to bound token cost.
6. **Submit** — `POST /pulls/{n}/reviews` with the summary and queued inline comments. On HTTP 422 (one bad anchor line in any comment ⇒ entire request rejected), the action retries summary-only and reports the dropped count in the tracking comment.
7. **Apply label** — applies `applied-label` if set and the strictness gate didn't block.
8. **Strictness gate** — exits 2 if blocked, 0 otherwise.

## Provider roadmap

| Provider | Family | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic (Claude) | chat-completions | ✅ shipping | Sonnet 4.6 default. Zero CLI install. |
| Claude Code CLI | agent-runner | 🚧 v1.1.0 (in progress) | `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` npm CLI in headless mode. Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. |
| Cursor Agent CLI | agent-runner | 🚧 v1.1.0 (in progress) | `cursor-agent` local CLI in headless mode. Uses `CURSOR_API_KEY`. |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | agent-runner | 🚧 v1.1.0 (in progress) | `@openai/codex` npm CLI in headless mode. Uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`. |
| OpenAI (raw API) | chat-completions | 🛠 roadmap (v1.2) | Direct chat-completions, no CLI install. |
| Google Gemini | chat-completions | 🛠 roadmap (v1.2) | Function-calling translation. |
| AWS Bedrock | chat-completions | 🤔 considering | Anthropic-shape under Bedrock. |

**Two provider families:**

- **`Provider`** (chat-completions family) — the action owns the tool-use loop, calling the model's API in a bounded turn count. No install step needed. Zero overhead for consumers.
- **`AgentRunnerProvider`** (agent-runner family) — a vendor's coding-agent CLI owns the tool-use loop; we shell out in headless mode and receive findings via `.aiprr/findings.json`. Better code comprehension (vendor-tuned tools, LSP, semantic search) at the cost of a CLI install step (only when the consumer opts in — modular install; see [docs/PROVIDERS.md](docs/PROVIDERS.md)).

Adding a new provider means implementing one class and registering it in `build_provider()`. Contributions welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## FAQ

**Why a custom action and not just `anthropics/claude-code-action`?**
That action's `restoreConfigFromBase` step crashes with `ENOENT` on repos that ship `.claude` as a symlink (a common pattern when consolidating multi-agent configs into a shared `.agents/` folder). This action removes that dependency and adds severity-based gating, configurable label gates, and a 422-recovery path the upstream action lacks.

**Why composite, not Docker?**
The reviewer is stdlib-only Python. A Docker action would add ~30s of pull time and a second supply chain (the image registry) for zero benefit.

**Will the model leak my code to the provider?**
The action sends the PR diff and any files the model `read_file`s to the configured provider. Treat it like any other LLM integration — review your provider's data-retention policy and use a self-hosted runner if you have specific constraints.

**Does it work on private repos?**
Yes. The default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` has the right scope; just make sure the repo's settings allow Actions to read content and write PR comments.

**Can I dogfood the reviewer on its own PRs?**
Yes — see `.github/workflows/self-review.yml` in this repo for the pattern.
